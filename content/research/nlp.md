title: Single Document Summarization
id: nlp
tagline: >
 For my senior capstone, we compared neural and combinatorial approaches to *extractive* single document summarization, where sentences from the document are concatenated into a summary. Our neural approaches were constructed from recent literature, and our combinatorial approaches reduced to MaxSAT or ILP. We also built a web-based visualizer to compare the summaries generated by different models.
