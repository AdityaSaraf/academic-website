title: "An \"Ethics-First\" Approach to Evidence"
id: dtd
tagline: >
 There are many ethical norms surrounding evidence. Evidence determines when researchers should halt drug trials, and what pharmaceutical companies are obliged to disclose to the public. Prosecutors and witnesses are obliged to disclose certain types of evidence in court trials, and jury members are obliged to be responsive to evidence when rendering their verdicts. But scientific evidence is often defined in purely statistical terms. We bridge this gap, by *deriving* theories of statistical evidence from ethical premises. Specifically, we argue that several theories of statistical evidence, including likelihoodism, Bayesian confirmation theory, and Robust Bayesianism (see below), answer the ethical question, "When is a scientist obliged to disclose experimental data or analysis?"

 In the future, we hope to extend our "ethics-first" approach to other epistemological concepts, such as knowledge or confirmation.
