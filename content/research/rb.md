title: "Robust Bayesianism: A New Theory of Statistical Evidence"
id: rb
tagline: >
 We investigate a new theory of statistical evidence that analyzes likelihood-based methods through a Bayesian lens. Our theory better clarifies the *objectivity* of evidence, and takes the view that evidence primarily serves as a tool to convince a community of the truth of some hypothesis. Our theory is technically interesting because it's compatible with weaker forms of rationality. Specifically, we work with a mathematical framework of qualitative, conditional probability, rather than quantitative degrees of belief.

 We start from the perspective that evidence is inherently *social* -- its primary purpose is persuasion. We thus formulate principles that essentially state that $E$ is good evidence for hypothesis $H_1$ over $H_2$ if it raises one's posterior in $H_1$ by more than one's posterior in $H_2$, regardless of one's prior (it thus convinces all Bayesian agents). Our theory is closely related to [likelihoodism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood_principle). We show that likelihoodist principles are equivalent to our Robust Bayesian principles in the standard setting, where agents are assumed to have probabilistic beliefs. However, our theory generalizes to a setting of qualitative belief functions, and in this broader setting only *some* likelihoodist principles have analogs, suggesting that those principles which don't generalize may simply be modeling artifacts. 

 In a related line of work, we argue that *social* norms of rationality better justify some aspects of Bayesianism, especially in scientific contexts. That paper is also listed below, as the 'Foundations Paper'
