title: "Robust Bayesianism: A New Theory of Statistical Evidence"
id: rb
tagline: >
 We investigate a new theory of statistical evidence that analyzes likelihood-based methods through a Bayesian lens. Our theory better clarifies the *objectivity* of evidence, and takes the view that evidence primarily serves as a tool to convince a community of the truth of some hypothesis. Our theory is technically interesting because it's compatible with weaker forms of rationality. Specifically, we work with a mathematical framework of qualitative, conditional probability, rather than quantitative degrees of belief.

 We start from the perspective that evidence is inherently *social* -- its primary purpose is persuasion. We thus formulate principles that essentially state that $E$ is good evidence for hypothesis $H_1$ over $H_2$ if it raises one's posterior in $H_1$ by more than one's posterior in $H_2$, regardless of one's prior (it's thus convincing for all Bayesian agents). We then show that our theory is a natural generalization of [likelihoodism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood_principle).

 From a mathematical perspective, our approach has several advantages. First, the Bayesian analysis allows us to handle several technical issues that plague likelihoodism, including handling composite hypotheses and experiments with nuisance parameters. Second, we work in a system of qualitative, conditional probability, which assumes agents have qualitative orderings over events (ordered by probability), and takes conditional probability to be primitive. These orderings are subject to many axioms (e.g. an analog of finite additivity). We prove analogs of several basic quantitative principles, such as Bayes' theorem and the law of total probability, and use these to prove that our theory naturally generalizes likelihoodism to settings of qualitative rationality.
