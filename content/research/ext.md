title: Present Bias in Competitive Task Completion
id: pb
tagline: >
 Can competition eliminate the harms of procrastination? We augment an existing model of present bias in task completion with a unique competitive twist, and find that a small amount of competition alleviates the significant harms of procrastination.
details: >
  We study a model of *present bias* (the tendency to prefer short term gains) in task completion, which is modelled by graph traversals.  Existing research shows that procrastination can come at a significant cost: biased agents can take *exponentially* more costly paths through a given graph. We augment this model by having two agents compete to finish the task first, with the winner getting a reward. We show that, for any graph, a *constant* amount of reward convinces biased agents to behave optimally, even when their natural behavior would have exponentially higher cost. The amount of reward needed to guarantee optimal behavior with competition is also significantly less (in general) than several non-competitive reward schemes in the existing literature. We build on a model originally proposed by Jon Kleinberg and Sigal Oren <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1254"></a>.
