title: Transaction Fee Mechanisms for Cryptocurrencies
id: crypto
tagline: >
 Several major cryptocurrencies, including blockchain and ethereum, have transaction fee "auctions", where users bid to have their transactions included by miners. One unique feature of these auctions is that the "auctioneer" is the miner, who is not a trusted party. Several recent papers have formalized these transaction fee mechanisms, and identified challenges in getting simultaneously user and miner incentive compatibility. We focus specifically on mechanisms that guarantee *miner* incentive compatibility, and show how these mechanisms affect the social welfare of transacting parties. In this way, our work can be viewed as identifying the "price" of user incentive compatible -- how much does social welfare decrease when we require that our mechanism is truthful?
