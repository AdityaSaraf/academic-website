 I spent a year at UW's [Tech Policy Lab](https://techpolicylab.uw.edu/), where I synthesized security/privacy research around new and upcoming technologies for legal and policy audiences. The areas I focused on were autonomous vehicles, IoT devices, and cell-site simulators (devices of dubious legality that police use to monitor local cell traffic). We published a paper on the attitudes of children and parents towards internet connected toys.
