title: Modelling Altruism in Kidney Exchanges
id: kidney
tagline: >
 We conducted preliminary (theoretical) research on the effects of altruistic donors in kidney exchanges, which were modelled as dynamic matching markets. This work is especially relevant in light of schemes to encourage altruism, such as the National Kidney Registry's [voucher program](https://www.kidneyregistry.org/info/voucher-program).
