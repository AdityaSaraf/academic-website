Hello and welcome to my portfolio. I am currently a Research Assistant in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Michigan, hosted by [Grant Schoenebeck](http://schoeneb.people.si.umich.edu/). I recently completed my M.S. in Computer Science at the University of Washington under [Anna Karlin](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~karlin/)'s supervision.

My primary research interests lie in the intersection of economics and computer science. I enjoy creating compelling and realistic mathematical models of behavior, and rigorously investigating the outcomes of these models. My Master's thesis formally modelled how agents might procrastinate when faced with a difficult task, and used competition to alleviate the harms of procrastination. I've also worked more broadly in theoretical computer science, investigating strong privacy definitions to protect correlated data and a unique, *hidden* property testing setting for graphs. In the past, I've done research in Tech Policy/HCI and Natural Language Processing.
<!-- I've recently worked on mechanisms for Bayesian differential privacy, a stronger version of the well-studied differential privacy that better protects correlated data. I have also investigated a unique property testing setting for graph properties, where the input graph was *hidden* by an oracle. Some graph properties are efficiently certifiable in this setting; we provided a partial classification. In the past, I've done research in Tech Policy/HCI and Natural Language Processing. -->

In addition to my CS interests, I'm also interested in Epistemology and Philosophy of Statistics. I've investigated to what extent rational agents are *obligated* to form beliefs according to logical laws. I'm currently designing a new, *social* theory of statistical evidence that builds on likelihood-based methods, and is mathematically interesting because it's compatible with weak, qualitative requirements on rationality.
