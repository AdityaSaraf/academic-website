Hello and welcome to my portfolio. I am currently a fourth year PhD student in Computer Science at Cornell Tech, where I am working with [Rafael Pass](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~rafael/) and [Joe Halpern](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/halpern/). Previously, I completed my M.S. in Computer Science at the University of Washington under [Anna Karlin](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~karlin/)'s supervision.

My primary research interest is exploring incentive problems in blockchains. I've recently worked on pricing problems for lending pools, and set the interest rates by relating them to financial options. More broadly, I'm interested in the intersection of economics and computer science. I enjoy creating compelling and realistic mathematical models of behavior, and rigorously investigating the outcomes of these models. My Master's thesis considered a model of how agents might procrastinate when faced with a difficult task, and used competition to alleviate the harms of procrastination. I've also worked more broadly in theoretical computer science, investigating strong privacy definitions to protect correlated data and coordination games on large social networks. In the past, I've done research in Tech Policy/HCI and NLP.
<!-- I've recently worked on mechanisms for Bayesian differential privacy, a stronger version of the well-studied differential privacy that better protects correlated data. I have also investigated a unique property testing setting for graph properties, where the input graph was *hidden* by an oracle. Some graph properties are efficiently certifiable in this setting; we provided a partial classification. In the past, I've done research in Tech Policy/HCI and Natural Language Processing. -->

In addition to my CS interests, I'm also interested in epistemology and the philosophy of statistics. I'm currently designing a new, *social* theory of statistical evidence, Robust Bayesianism (RB), that extends likelihood-based methodologies to broader settings. RB is mathematically interesting because it's compatible with weak, qualitative requirements on rationality. I'm also working on connecting statistical definitions of evidence to more commonplace ethical definitions of evidence, with the goal of providing an "ethics-first" approach to evidence, and to epistemology more generally.
