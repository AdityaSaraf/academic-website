abstract: "We investigate whether qualitative analogs of the likelihood principle (LP) and related likelihoodist theses can be justified by informal, everyday reasoning.  To do so, we first *formulate* qualitative analogs of two likelihoodist theses: LP and the law of likelihood (LL). Then, using a framework for qualitative conditional probability, we prove three novel theorems that suggest that, just as LP conflicts with virtually every non-Bayesian approach to statistical inference, the qualitative analogs of LP and LL motivate -- and are best motivated by -- qualitative forms of Bayesian reasoning."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
# summary: We augment an existing model of present bias with a competitive element. We show that competition, and a small amount of reward, can alleviate the substantial harms of present bias in various settings.
